# System Overview

## Architecture Overview

Electro is built on a modern, scalable architecture that follows Clean Architecture principles and implements the CQRS pattern. The system is divided into several key layers and components:

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Electro Frontend (React.js)**
  - User interface for customers and administrators
  - Responsive design for all devices
  - Component-based architecture
  - State management using Redux
  - Material-UI for consistent design

### 2. Application Layer
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Request/Response handling
  - Input validation
  - Authentication and authorization
  - API versioning

### 3. Domain Layer
- **Core Business Logic**
  - Entity definitions
  - Business rules
  - Domain events
  - Value objects
  - Domain services

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Data Access**
  - Entity Framework Core
  - Repository pattern implementation
  - Database migrations
  - Data seeding

### 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Caching (Redis)**
  - Product catalog caching
  - Component specifications caching
  - Session management
  - Cache invalidation strategies

- **Security**
  - JWT authentication
  - Role-based authorization
  - API security
  - Data encryption

## Key Components

### 1. Product Management System
- Product catalog
- Component specifications
- Technical documentation
- Inventory management
- Category management

### 2. Order Processing System
- Shopping cart
- Checkout process
- Order tracking
- Payment processing
- Invoice generation

### 3. User Management System
- User registration
- Profile management
- Role management
- Authentication
- Authorization

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- Sales analytics
- Inventory control
- User management
- Order management
- Content management

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**
   - HTTP requests from React frontend
   - API endpoint routing
   - Request validation

2. **Command/Query Processing**
   - CQRS pattern implementation
   - Command handling for write operations
   - Query handling for read operations
   - Event sourcing for important operations

3. **Data Access**
   - Repository pattern
   - Database operations
   - Caching layer (Redis)
   - Data persistence

4. **Response Handling**
   - Response formatting
   - Error handling
   - Status codes
   - Data transformation

## Integration Points

### 1. External Services
- Payment gateways
- Email services
- Analytics tools
- Technical documentation providers

### 2. Third-Party APIs
- Component datasheets
- Pricing information
- Inventory updates
- Shipping calculations

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Redis distributed caching
- Cache invalidation
- Cache warming
- Cache consistency

### 2. Database Optimization
- Indexing
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Data partitioning

### 3. API Performance
- Response compression
- Request throttling
- API rate limiting
- Response caching

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication
- Refresh token mechanism
- Password hashing
- Multi-factor authentication

### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Permission-based authorization
- API endpoint security
- Resource-level security

### 3. Data Protection
- Data encryption
- Secure communication (HTTPS)
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Application Monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- User activity
- System health

### 2. Logging
- Application logs
- Error logs
- Audit logs
- Security logs

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Development Environment
- Local development setup
- Development database
- Testing environment
- CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Production Environment
- Load balancing
- High availability
- Disaster recovery
- Backup strategies
